	<h2>Going to learn how html and css works </h2>
	<!--------paragraph----------->
	<p>&#128512;<strong>The HyperText Markup Language</strong>, or <i>HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser</i>. It can be assisted by<em> technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</em> and <mark>scripting languages such as JavaScript.</mark><br>

<small>&#128516;Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.</small> HTML <del>describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document</del>.<br>

&#128525;HTML<ins>elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs</ins>, <sub>images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.</sub> HTML <sup>provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as</sup> <q>headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items</q>.<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr><cite>elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</cite> <bdo dir="rtl">Tags such as <!-- <img /> --> and <!-- <input /> --> directly introduce content into the page.</bdo> Other tags such as <!-- <p> --> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

&#128151;HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.&#128509;The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997&#128220;.[2].<br>
